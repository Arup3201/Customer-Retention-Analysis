# Reducing Customer Churn of ABC Bank

ABC bank stakeholder have reached out to me for the solution of their recent surge in customer churn. This alarming trend is significantly impacting their long-standing relationship with their clients.

To solve this problem, they need a data scientist who can help them understand the underlying cause of this sudden increase in customer defection.

In this project, I will perform data analysis using Python and libraries to solve this problem. Objective of this project is to learn more about data analysis practically and also to understand the flow of a real-life project in a company.

## Business Problem

ABC bank want me to find out the cause of the customer defection. Mainly they want me to see the relation between this customer churn with other factors like customer dissatisfaction, competitive pressure and customer preferences.

The problem in hand incorporates 5 things to do:

1. **Customer Behavior Patterns:** Analyze recent customer interactions, transactions, and service usage to identify any discernible patterns or anomalies that might be indicative of disengagement or dissatisfaction.

2. **Service Satisfaction Metrics:** Evaluate the effectiveness of our current customer service strategies and identify areas for improvement. Are there specific services or touchpoints that consistently result in customer dissatisfaction?

3. **Competitive Benchmarking:** Conduct a comparative analysis with other leading banks in our market to identify any superior practices or features that may be attracting our customers away.

4. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop predictive models to forecast potential churn candidates based on historical data. This will enable us to proactively address concerns and tailor retention strategies.

5. **Customer Feedback Analysis:** Scrutinize customer feedback channels, such as surveys and complaints, to pinpoint recurring issues and sentiments that may be contributing to the churn.

The ultimate goal is not just to understand the cause of the customer churn but also to implement effective measures that will help retain the valued clients.

## Business Understanding

**Customer Profiling**: Analyzing customer behaviour patterns such as their interactions, transactions and service usage to understand each group of customers and find out the properties of those groups. From this, we can also find out which group has properties of dissatisfaction or disengagement which essentially means to find the groups that has more chances of churn.

**Regression Analysis of Customer Satisfaction**: Using regression to predict or estimate the customer satisfaction of customers towards customer service strategies. Analyzing the difference between satisfied and dissatisfied customers using the regression prediction. Then, looking at the features that differentiate the 2 groups and thinking of strategies to improve on those features.

**Clustering Analysis with Other Banks**: Grouping the banks with other banks and finding out the different clusters that have different properties. Looking for the ABC bank among the clusters and finding the group that has higher competitive advantage over ABC bank. Then, we can find the difference in features that creates this competitive advantage when we can try to bring that same feature values at ABC bank.

**Class Probablity Estimation**: Predicting the probablities of the customer churning from ABC bank using classification technique. It helps forecasting potential churn candidates based on historical data. It will help us in understanding the customers who are going to churn, ans then focus next services on only those who have better chances of turning back. It will also help in understanding the candidates who have highest churn rate and their problems.

**Sentiment Analysis of Customer feedbacks, complaints and surveys**: Using NLP to examine the sentiment of the feedbacks and researching the words that are used when the sentiment is negative can help in finding out what customers are dissatisfied about and also whatever we find positive from the positive sentiment, whether we can include that to improve customer experiences.
