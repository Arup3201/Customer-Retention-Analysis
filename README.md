# Reducing Customer Churn of Telco

Telco company stakeholder have reached out to me for the solution of their recent surge in customer churn. This alarming trend is significantly impacting their long-standing relationship with their clients.

To solve this problem, they need a data scientist who can help them understand the underlying cause of this sudden increase in customer defection.

In this project, I will perform data analysis using Python and libraries to solve this problem. Objective of this project is to learn more about data analysis practically and also to understand the flow of a real-life project in a company.

## Problems and Goal

Telco communication is finding difficulty to keep customers for a long time and recently they are facing the rapidly growing problem of customer churn. They want a model that can help them understand which customers are likely to churn and which customers are loyal. Also this will help them focus more on the loyal customers and improve on the possible churn customers. Throughout this process, they also want to learn which factors are more detrimental for customer churn and effectively they want to work on those factors. Not only that, they also want an analysis of the whole customer churn and want to know insights that can improve their customer retention.

So, the goal of this project is to deliver the analysis related to customer churn and some suggestions to improve, model that can predict customer churn, importance of features that highly contribute to the customer churn.
