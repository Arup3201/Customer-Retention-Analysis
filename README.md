# Reducing Customer Churn of Teleco

Telco company stakeholder have reached out to me for the solution of their recent surge in customer churn. This alarming trend is significantly impacting their long-standing relationship with their clients.

To solve this problem, they need a data scientist who can help them understand the underlying cause of this sudden increase in customer defection.

In this project, I will perform data analysis using Python and libraries to solve this problem. Objective of this project is to learn more about data analysis practically and also to understand the flow of a real-life project in a company.

## Business Problem

Telco company want me to find out the cause of the customer defection. Mainly they want me to see the relation between this customer churn with other factors like customer dissatisfaction, competitive pressure and customer preferences.

The problem in hand incorporates 2 things to do:

1. **Customer Behavior Patterns:** Analyze recent customer interactions, transactions, and service usage to identify any discernible patterns or anomalies that might be indicative of disengagement or dissatisfaction.

2. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop predictive models to forecast potential churn candidates based on historical data. This will enable us to proactively address concerns and tailor retention strategies.

The ultimate goal is not just to understand the cause of the customer churn but also to implement effective measures that will help retain the valued clients.

## Business Understanding

- **Customer Profiling**: Analyzing customer behaviour patterns such as their interactions, transactions and service usage to understand each group of customers and find out the properties of those groups. From this, we can also find out which group has properties of dissatisfaction or disengagement which essentially means to find the groups that has more chances of churn.

- **Class Probablity Estimation**: Predicting the probablities of the customer churning from Teleco company using classification technique. It helps forecasting potential churn candidates based on historical data. It will help us in understanding the customers who are going to churn, ans then focus next services on only those who have better chances of turning back. It will also help in understanding the candidates who have highest churn rate and their problems.
